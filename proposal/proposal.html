        <h2>Part1: Problem Domain</h2>
        <p>
            Our team is interested in the topic of pet adoption. Adopting a pet involves taking it into one's home and
            providing it with affection, food, and shelter.
            Yet, in most cases of pet adoption, the adopter lacks a full grasp of the pet's basic behaviors, resulting
            in the abandonment of many animals.
            In addition, the adoption procedure can be troublesome. There are various factors to consider when adopting
            a pet, including the animal's breed, age, gender, temperament, and health.
        <p>
            The information technology issue in this industry is the need for a centralized platform for pet adoption
            that provides complete capabilities and a comprehensive introduction of the pets to aid potential pet owners
            in locating and adopting dogs.
            Current pet adoption websites offer limited functionality, such as basic search and filtering choices, but
            no advanced features, such as searching for a more personalized and comprehensive filter, comparing various
            pets, making a favorites list, or completing an adoption application.
        </p>
        <p>
            One existing attempt to solve this problem is <cite><a
                    href="https://www.petfinder.com/search/dogs-for-adoption/us/wa/seattle/">“Petfinder”</a></cite>,
            a famous website for pet adoption that gives search and filtering tools to assist potential pet owners in
            locating animals in their region.
            Nevertheless, Petfinder does not offer sophisticated capabilities such as comparing various animals, making
            a favorites list, or filing an adoption application.
        </p>
        <p>
            A new web application with sophisticated features such as search and filtering choices, favorites list,
            adoption application, and comparison function may be constructed to solve this existing issue that users
            cannot have a more personalized adoption system to adopt pets.
            This program can make the pet adoption process more accessible and efficient, allowing potential pet owners
            to locate the ideal pet and providing shelter animals with a greater chance of finding them forever home.

        <h2>Part2: App Description</h2>
        <p>
            The user of our app is targeting potential pet owners who are interested in adopting pets and aims to make
            the pet adoption process more accessible, efficient, and personalized.
            The proposed web application aims to address the issue of pet adoption by providing a centralized platform
            that offers comprehensive capabilities and a complete introduction of pets to potential pet owners.
            The app is designed to help users find their ideal pet and provide shelter animals with a greater chance of
            finding a forever home.
            For minority groups, our online platform can help Potential adopters who are completely new to pet fostering
            have a comprehensive understanding of the pet they are adopting before adopting.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some main functions in our system:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Search filters: Users of the application will access the website to search for and filter pets based on
                various criteria, not only include some basic filters, such as breed, size, age, gender, location, and
                habit,
                but include some advanced and personalized filter, such as the alertness of the pet, the character of
                the pet, the appetite of the pet, whether the pet is suitable for a girl, the physique of an adult pet,
                and whether the pet has received professional training.
            </li>
            <li>
                Favorite Lists: The user will have a function of a favorites list of pets they are interested in
                adopting after logging or signing up an account in our platform.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adoption application: The users can fill out an adoption application online, including some personal
                information, such as the living status, marital status, current pet status at home, age status, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pets comparison: The users can compare different kinds of pets or different pets in one kind using a
                comparison table. The web app will be interactive and will contain buttons, forms, and other features
                that enable users to provide input and modify how data is presented to them.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The users will view information about various pets, including their breed, age, gender, temperament, health,
            and adoption fee.
            The app will use a <cite><a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/adoptable-pets">CSV file</a> </cite> to
            draw data and provide users with comprehensive information on pets available for adoption.
            The app will not only offer advanced search and filtering choices but also include features that enable
            users to make informed decisions about pet adoption.
            By using our app, not only the pet adopter can have a more comprehensive understanding of their pets so that
            they can have an opportunity to familiarize themselves with pets in advance,
            but also, pet adopters find their favorite pets more efficiently at the same time, which can minimize the
            situation of pets being abandoned again.
